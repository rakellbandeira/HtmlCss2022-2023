                <p>Hey guys! Rakell here, hope everyone is feeling as excited as me!</p>
                <p>I'm from Brazil and to put it simple, my goal is to study hard and improve my skills to get jobs designing programs, web and mobile applications.
                    Some personal information: I am single, currently in a relationship with a wonderful man, have a 5-years-old cutepie, and beautiful sisters and parents (in the picture: I am the second from the left); we are all members of the Church. I enjoy books, series, drawing, singing and playing piano.</p>
                <p>What I love the most about BYU is having this A-M-A-Z-I-N-G quality of content, teachers and classmates from all the parts of the world, besides the weekly devotionals. There's nothing like that anywhere. I'm pursuing Applied Technology BS degree and this time the ship is going to sail hahaha no giving up until get it done.</p>  
                <p>I have many favorite verses on the BM, but one that fits our situation is this one: <br> <strong>"Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means the Lord has provided for us?"</strong> Alma 60:21. If we make use of ALL the means the Lord has provided us, He will deliver us.</p>
                <p>Hoping we can be of help to each other and bond along this semester.</p>
                <p>Thanks, Rakell.</p>
